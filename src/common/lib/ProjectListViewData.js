      'ScienceAtHome is a project developed by Aarhus University. It harnesses the brain-power of thousands of people around the world through gamification, and uses the data to help build a quantum computer. Fascinating!',
      'I was part of a two-man team that turned a hi-fidelity mock-up into an interactive, modular and easy to modify web-app that hosts the project.',
      'Immediately after its release, the website was featured in a number of major online media such as Nature, Science, The Verge, Gizmodo and Ars Technica. It performed extremely well under the high load, and given the tight deadline that we had for finishing it, we were ecstatic.',
      'Working in a close relationship with the amazing team at AU jump-started my love for JS with Meteor and React, and was an eye-opener to ES6',

The website has simple functionality and CMS, so even though making it included creating a theme from scratch, most of the work was actually done in SCSS - the pages are alive with animations and subtle effects, which we left as nice surprises to the users to discover.',

      'The stylesheets were written in SCSS again, only this time using heavily modified Semantic UI elements as a base. To avoid falling into an insanity pit brim-full of overwrites and hellfire, we used CSS modules. It was the first time I’d used that technology, but its specificity-based and ultra-modular nature grew on me in no time.',

For all my resentment at the platform, it was worth the time and effort, if only for bringing those two into my life.',
